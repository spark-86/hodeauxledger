# hodeauxledger
HodeauxLedger is the current implementation of the ledger powering Temporal Cryptophysics. It provides an append-only, cryptographically signed record model (R⬢) anchored to Genesis Time (GT), with scope-bound policy, role grants, and usher K-of-N quorum. CBOR on the wire, auditable by design—scope or it didn’t happen.
